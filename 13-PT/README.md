Unfortunately I wasn't able to put the .jmx files due to some malfunction with the software that wouldn't allow me to save the plans, but instead i attached the screenshot of the plan. I hope that you won't have anything against that, i also added the screenshot of the error message.\

### Update
I manged to recreate the test plans on a different PC and then save them.
